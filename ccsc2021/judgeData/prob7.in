		     An Excerpt from Washington  
		        "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"

	In this by-place of nature, there abode, in a remote period of
American history, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of
the name of Ichabod Crane; who sojourned, or, as he expressed it, "tarried,"
in Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity.
He was a native of Connecticut; a State which supplies the Union with pioneers
for the mind as well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its legions of
frontier woodsmen and country schoolmasters. The cognomen of Crane was not
inapplicable to his person. He was tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow
shoulders, long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves,
feet that might have served for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung
together. His head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green
glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock,
perched upon his spindle neck, to tell which way the wind blew.

      His school-house was a low building of one large room, rudely
constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched with
leaves of old copy-books.  The school-house stood in a rather lonely but
pleasant situation, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook running
close by, and a formidable birch tree growing at one end of it. From hence
the low murmur of his pupils' voices, conning over their lessons, might be
heard of a drowsy summer's day, like the hum of a beehive; interrupted now
and then by the authoritative voice of the master, in the tone of menace or
command; or, peradventure, by the appalling sound of the birch, as he urged
some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge. Truth to say, he was
a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, "Spare the rod
and spoil the child."- Ichabod Crane's scholars certainly were not spoiled.
